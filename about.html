              <h1>About This Site</h1>
              My childhood home had one magical room. <br /><br />
              Floor to ceiling shelves were filled with science fiction books, radio and software guides, various batteries, and electronics. A tall rack metal rack was home to four gray computer towers, a printer, and a scanner. 
              A single monitor in the middle of a wooden desk was my window to the early days of the internet.
              Through the late 90s and the 2000s, I grew curious and obsessed with everything the internet had to offer. <br /><br />
              This site is a love letter to those times when the web felt new and sparkly. <br /><br />
              The time when HTML was still a mystery that I hadnâ€™t yet figured out. <br /><br />
              I want web development to always feel like how it was back then- new and fresh with infinite things to learn. <br /><br />
